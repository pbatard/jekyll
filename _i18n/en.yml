  description: Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives, such as USB keys/pendrives, memory sticks, etc.
  use_case_header: 'It can be especially useful for cases where:'
  use_case_1: you need to create USB installation media from bootable ISOs (Windows, Linux, UEFI, etc.)
  use_case_2: you need to work on a system that doesn't have an OS installed
  use_case_3: you need to flash a BIOS or other firmware from DOS
  use_case_4: you want to run a low-level utility
  small_size: Despite its small size, Rufus provides everything you need!
  fast_speed: >-
    Oh, and Rufus is <b>fast</b>. For instance it's about twice as fast as <a target="_blank" %s>UNetbootin</a>,
    <a target="_blank" %s>Universal USB Installer</a> or <a target="_blank" %s>Windows 7 USB download tool</a>,
    on the creation of a Windows 7 USB installation drive from an ISO. It is also marginally faster on the creation
    of Linux bootable USB from ISOs.
  non_exhaustive_link: A non exhaustive list of Rufus supported ISOs is also provided at the bottom of this page.

  translators_thanks: >-
    I will take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the translators who
    made it possible for Rufus, as well as this webpage, to be translated in
    various languages. If you find that you can use Rufus in your own language,
    you should really thank them!

  v1_2_0_or_earlier: (v1.2.0 or earlier)
  dos_notes_hdr: 'Notes on DOS support:'
  dos_notes: >-
    If you create a DOS bootable drive and use a non-US keyboard, Rufus will
    attempt to select a keyboard layout according to the locale of your system.
    In that case, <a target="_blank" %s>FreeDOS</a>, which is the default
    selection, is recommended over MS-DOS, as it supports more keyboard layouts.
  iso_notes_hdr: 'Notes on ISO Support:'
  iso_notes: >-
    All versions of Rufus since v1.1.0 allow the creation of a bootable USB from
    an <a target="_blank" %s>ISO image</a> (.iso)."
  iso_create: >-
    Creating an ISO image from a physical disc or from a set of files is very
    easy to do however, through the use of a CD burning application, such as the
    freely available <a target="_blank" %s>InfraRecorder</a> or <a target="_blank"
    %s>CDBurnerXP</a>.

  donations: Donations
  donations_1: >-
    Since I'm getting asked about this on regular basis, there is <b>no</b> donation button on this page.
  donations_2: >-
    The main reason is that I feel that the donation system doesn't actually
    help software development and worse, can be guilt-inducing for users who
    choose not to donate.
  donations_3: >-
    If you really insist, you can always make a donation to the <a target="_blank"
    %s>Free Software Foundation</a>, as they are the main reason software like Rufus
    is possible.
  donations_4: >-
    At any rate, I'll take this opportunity to say <i><u>thank you</u></i> for your
    continuing support and enthusiasm about this little program: it is much appreciated!
  donations_5: >-
    But please continue to feel free to use Rufus without any guilt about not contributing
    for it financially &ndash; you should never have to!
